# MODULE 6: WeatherPy with Python APIs

## Overview of the Analysis
* In this module I applied analysis, visualizations and statistical skills while learning how to retrieve data from a website through an application programming interface, or API. Gathering data from an API is more practical and efficient than trying to obtain data directly from the web. Like in web scraping, especially if you want to get megabytes or gigabytes of data, web APUs allow clients to request data from a website or database server within the confines of the website's rules. When you retrieve data from an API, the data is returned to you in a variety of formats. One of the most popular formats is the JavaScript object notation or JASON, which uses a hierarchical structure to store metadata in multiple dictionaries key value pairs, as opposed to CSV and TSB files.

* In this module I worked with Jupyter Notebook, Python Pandas, the Python CityPy module, Python requests,  to collect weather data from over 500 cities around the world. I realized data using Pandas and plotted the data using the matplotlib  library and Google Maps API.

* Finally, I performed a statistical analysis with the OSI Py library. My end product is a series of plots that visually and statistically show the relationship between latitude and a variety of weather factors.


### Purpose
* Create a Python code that will help me design a vacation according to weather factors, using APIs and visualizations.
