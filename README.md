# MODULE 6: WeatherPy with Python APIs

I will learn how to use an application programming interface, or API, to access particular data from a website while using analysis, visualization, and statistical abilities in this module.

If I want to collect megabytes or gigabytes of data, gathering data via an API is more practical and efficient than trying to grab data straight from the web like in web scraping. With the use of web APIs, a client may make data requests that adhere to the restrictions of a website or database server.

Data is delivered to the client in a variety of formats when it is retrieved from an API. The JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON, is one of the most widely used forms. As contrast to CSV and TSB files, many analysts favor JSON format since it has a hierarchical structure and holds metadata in a number of dictionaries or key value pairs.

In this module, I'll gather meteorological information from more than 500 cities worldwide using Jupyter Notebooks, Python, the CityPy module, the Python requests modules, APIs, and JSON traversals. After that, I'll use Pandas to analyze the data using the Matplotlib package and Google Maps API to plot it.

Finally, I'll use the SciPy library to do a statistical analysis. A set of charts that aesthetically and statistically demonstrate the link between a latitude and several weather characteristics will be the final product.

Let's learn how to retrieve data from an API, store that data in a data frame, plot, the data using Matplotlib, and Google Maps and perform statistical analysis.

## Overview of the Analysis
* In this module I applied analysis, visualizations and statistical skills while learning how to retrieve data from a website through an application programming interface, or API. Gathering data from an API is more practical and efficient than trying to obtain data directly from the web. Like in web scraping, especially if you want to get megabytes or gigabytes of data, web APUs allow clients to request data from a website or database server within the confines of the website's rules. When you retrieve data from an API, the data is returned to you in a variety of formats. One of the most popular formats is the JavaScript object notation or JASON, which uses a hierarchical structure to store metadata in multiple dictionaries key value pairs, as opposed to CSV and TSB files.

* In this module I worked with Jupyter Notebook, Python Pandas, the Python CityPy module, Python requests,  to collect weather data from over 500 cities around the world. I realized data using Pandas and plotted the data using the matplotlib  library and Google Maps API.

* Finally, I performed a statistical analysis with the OSI Py library. My end product is a series of plots that visually and statistically show the relationship between latitude and a variety of weather factors.

### Purpose
* Create a Python code that will help me design a vacation according to weather factors, using APIs and visualizations.
